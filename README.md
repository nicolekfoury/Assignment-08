# Assignment-07
#### Introduction/Summary:
For this week's introduction to the high-fidelity prototype, I focused on tailoring the various webpages of myhealthfinder.gov in accordance with the usability testing, observations, and personas, and first impressions Iâ€™ve culminated over the last weeks of class. I believe that myhealthfinder.gov, a government-run website, has enormous potential to be valuable for Americans getting their basic health questions answered at their fingertips. With that being said, the existing site has a lot of interface issues, especially on the homepage. This prototype, which has newly improved features such as an accessible main menu, a favorite's option for health articles one might like, and a share/print option for vaccines and screenings they still need to complete, allow the user to make the most of the website and truly cater it to their own needs so that the information obtained is valuable to them in the long run.

My Wireframes so far are pages pertaining to these 3 tasks:
1. Fill out the immunization questionnaire and look at your results. Mark whatever immunizations you have completed, and email the ones that you still have to do to yourself.
2. Find information about Nutrition during Pregnancy. Among the many articles, favorite one to have in your archives for later.
3. Without looking over the main menu, find an article related to diet suggestions pertaining to diebetes.

#### Design Description:
Since my prototype is oriented in the medical field, I thought that different hues of blue would be suitable for a color scheme choice for two reasons. Firstly, many designs for anything related to healthcare use cool-toned colors, and I wanted there to be a sense of familiarity in my design. I chose my font (Verdana) because it is easily legible, and familiar to the viewer as well as a common font to use, especially in website design. With these guidelines in mind, I pieced together three different sets of wireframes which primarily defer in layout and slight color changes.

(Not sure why the screenshot is pixelated, but my scores are both 76 for each prototype. There is definitely room for improvement, especially in the color-contrast area.

#### Summary of Impression Test:
Overall, the first impressions that I recieved were what I was expecting. My colors can be tweaked a little bit, as they're either too bright or too muted. The wireframes seem easy to follow so far, my participant had a little bit of difficulty, but I think it was due to her being caught off guard with the whole testing experience in general. I found myself having to be extra patient, but her hesitation to answer certain questions indicated to me where I need to improve. 

#### Reflection
So far, after hearing what my roommate had to say about my first round of high-fidelity prototypes along with examining the accessibility score, I definitely have room for improvement. I did not expect this to be an easy one-and-done task, and I look forward to making more changes based on what the reviewers say on the 24th. Overall, I think my color choice is the biggest focus, but I am pretty confident in the layout that I chose as my favorite. It seems to make the most sense to the eye what is important to click on the screen, verses an overload of unneccessary information.
