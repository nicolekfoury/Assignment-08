# Assignment-08
#### Introduction/Summary:
For this week's introduction to the high-fidelity prototype, I focused on tailoring the various webpages of myhealthfinder.gov in accordance with the usability testing, observations, and personas, and first impressions I’ve culminated over the last weeks of class. I believe that myhealthfinder.gov, a government-run website, has enormous potential to be valuable for Americans getting their basic health questions answered at their fingertips. With that being said, the existing site has a lot of interface issues, especially on the homepage. This prototype, which has newly improved features such as an accessible main menu, a favorite's option for health articles one might like, and a share/print option for vaccines and screenings they still need to complete, allow the user to make the most of the website and truly cater it to their own needs so that the information obtained is valuable to them in the long run.

My Wireframes so far are pages pertaining to these 3 tasks:
1. Fill out the immunization questionnaire and look at your results. Email the results to yourself. 
2. Without browsing the main menu option, try to search for topics related to “fitness.” Read through the articles you find.
3. Browse the main menu, and find helpful links about Nutrition during Pregnancy. 


#### Design Description:
Since my prototype is oriented in the medical field, I thought that different hues of blue would be suitable for a color scheme choice for two reasons. Firstly, many designs for anything related to healthcare use cool-toned colors, and I wanted there to be a sense of familiarity in my design. I chose my font (Verdana) because it is easily legible, and familiar to the viewer as well as a common font to use, especially in website design. With these guidelines in mind, I pieced together three different sets of wireframes which primarily defer in layout and slight color changes.

#### Summary of Impression Test:
Overall, the first impressions that I recieved were what I was expecting. My colors can be tweaked a little bit, as they're either too bright or too muted. The wireframes seem easy to follow so far, my participant had a little bit of difficulty, but I think it was due to her being caught off guard with the whole testing experience in general. I found myself having to be extra patient, but her hesitation to answer certain questions indicated to me where I need to improve. 

#### Reflection
Creating my final prototype with Adobe XD was straight forward in some ways, and challenging in others. As I began to create the different wireframes in order to navigate successfully through the different tasks, I ran into certain issues in terms of what was logical and practical to include on each page, versus what was superfluous because it could be accessed more efficiently on one page more than another. The actual prototyping navigation was fairly straight forward, though I did run into some issues when testing it out on the actual webpage. Clicking the same button on each page only worked certain times for some reason, and I am still unsure if this is some sort of accessibility error in webpage format.
